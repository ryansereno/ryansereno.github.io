The rent for life (own nothing and be happy) agenda is in full force when it comes to the modern media/ subscription services.

We're creating an era where it is impossible to own music and movies.

Even PURCHASING media on a platform like amazon does not guarantee ownership- amazon has already lost license rights to movies and removed them from customers' libraries, despite them purchasing the movies.

More concerning to me is that Spotify holds our playlists that have taken years to curate.
Spotify is always just one license agreement away from losing much of their music, just as Netflix lost their popular content to competitors.

We need to take ownership of our media and wean ourselves off of the rent for life model.

Self hosted servers/ network attached storage (NAS) is becoming more affordable and user friendly.
It's becoming more common for people to self host their files.

Buy physical copies of music and movies as much as you can (Goodwill is great).

It will take a lot of patience to rebuild our media libraries, but I think it will be worth it as media companies become more predatory and slice the streaming pie into smaller segments.
