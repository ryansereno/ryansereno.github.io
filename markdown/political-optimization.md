The concept of maintaining 'traditional' conservative values seems flawed to me.
Human society is a young experiment.
How we can say that a set of values from a short arbitrary time period (1950's America) is the pinnacle of truth for human society?

It reminds me of the local minima problem in machine learning.
During training, it can appear as if the model is fully optimized, when in reality there is a far more optimal set of parameters, it just cannot be seen from the perspective of the current local minima.

To extend the analogy, the most effective machine learning algorithms use a combination of small (conservative) and large (liberal) parameter changes to find the global minima.
This process can temporarily reduce the effectiveness of the model, but for the payoff of achieving a far more optimized end product.

It is only through a combination of small (conservative) and large (liberal) changes that a society can find its truly optimized state.
And this must be done repeatedly, because the input data- culture, technology, geopolitics- change throughout history.
