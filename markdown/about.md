# About

Beliefs that I hold strongly:

 Learning is the second most important skill you can develop in life
- It's a superpower to be able to repeatedly and reliably explore, triangulate, and understand new disciplines 
 Gratitude is the *most* important skill
- Gratitude isn't something that is passively felt during good times, but something that must be actively exercised during challenging times
 Most disciplines (from the natural sciences to the arts) are burdened by needless complexity
- The Design, Terminology, and Pedagogy of these disciplines are intentionally made complex in order to make the practitioners appear smarter
 Advertising is truly evil
- Modern advertising is increasingly subtle, manipulative, and natively embedded.
- The advertising business model has ruined the modern internet.
- Every person has a duty to use Ad blockers

I used to be an organic/ analytical chemist, and started building software for my lab.
Now I build software mostly because it's too expensive to have a fully stocked wet lab in my house.

I'm primarily interested in proteomics/ enzymology, machine learning, language modeling, hardware, and robotics.

I joined <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/sparc_logo.0195edfb5e2925dc2f17.png" alt="SPARC logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline;"> in 2017 to design their GMP manufacturing laboratory and data pipelines.
I also tried to launch a couple B2B SaaS products- in 2020 I built Quartet <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/Quartet%20logo%20small.89a666cf503945a18a91.jpeg" alt="Quartet logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline; border-radius:5px;">, paving the way for standardized medical cannabis testing data in California.
In 2022, I built Palm <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/palm-logo.90b4e76b5d481d538d64.png" alt="Palm logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline; border-radius:5px;">, a project management platform for condos.
