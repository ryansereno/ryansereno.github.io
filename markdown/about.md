<h1 align="center">About</h1>

Beliefs that I hold strongly:

 - Learning is the second most important skill you can develop in life
	 - It's a superpower to be able to repeatedly and reliably explore, triangulate, and understand new disciplines 

 - Gratitude is the *most* important skill
	 - Gratitude isn't something that is passively felt during good times, but something that must be actively exercised during challenging times
	 
- Most disciplines (from the natural sciences to the arts) are burdened by needless complexity
	 - The Design, Terminology, and Pedagogy of these disciplines are intentionally made complex in order to make the practitioners appear smarter

 - Advertising is evil
	 - Modern advertising is subtle, manipulative, and algorithmically optimized to coerce large portions of the population
	 - The advertising business model has ruined the modern internet and destroyed people's finances
	 - It's called an "advertising campaign" because it is an assault on your mind and your wallet.
	 - There are tools to effectively fight against this; no person needs to ever be exposed to digital advertising again.

Professionally, I'm an organic chemist and software engineer.

Now I mostly just build software, because it's impractical to have a fully stocked wet lab in my house.

I'm interested in proteomics/ enzymology, machine learning, language modeling, hardware, and robotics.

I joined <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/sparc_logo.0195edfb5e2925dc2f17.png" alt="SPARC logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline;"> in 2017 to design their GMP manufacturing laboratory and data pipelines.
I also launched a couple B2B SaaS products- in 2020 I built Quartet <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/Quartet%20logo%20small.89a666cf503945a18a91.jpeg" alt="Quartet logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline; border-radius:5px;">, paving the way for standardized medical cannabis testing data in California.
In 2022, I built Palm <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/palm-logo.90b4e76b5d481d538d64.png" alt="Palm logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline; border-radius:5px;">, a project management platform for condos.
