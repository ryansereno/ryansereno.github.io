Organic chemist turned software engineer.

I'm primarily interested in proteomics/ enzymology, language modeling, hardware, and robotics.

In 2022, I briefly led the engineering of the Palm <img src="https://portfolio.ryansereno.com/static/media/palm-logo.90b4e76b5d481d538d64.png" alt="Palm logo" style="height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; display: inline; border-radius:5px;"> project management platform.
